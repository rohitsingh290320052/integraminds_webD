              <p>
                When someone tells you this, your initial reaction is to likely
                try to fight the urge to think about your breath, and soon
                you’ll realize that the more effort you put in to fight it i.e.
                the more you try to not think about thinking about your breath,
                the more you’re unlikely to be successful in doing so. It’s only
                by completely letting go, giving up your sense of control of the
                breath, that you’re able to get it to return to its natural
                rhythm and fade into the background of your mind.

                  One of the funny things about the mind is that it doesn’t like
                  being told what to do, despite it being the one telling it
                  what to do.

              <p>
                For the past 4 months (starting last December), I’ve been
                exploring this idea and the inner processes of my own mind
                through daily meditation. This practice initially started as an
                attempt to try to calm my own mind from the sporadic thoughts
                that tended to cloud my daily life, but has since developed into
                a daily routine that provides me so much joy and has helped
                build my ability to feel compassion and empathy toward others,
                and ultimately learn how to live more intentionally.
              </p>
              <p>
                This term “meditation” gets thrown around a lot but it’s really
                just a fancy word for “focused awareness of what’s happening
                right now”. The idea around meditation is that by focusing your
                mind on what’s happening right now, your mind will become
                clearer and calmer.&nbsp;
              </p>
              <p>
                If I may entertain you for a few minutes more, I’m going to
                reflect and share with you a few things that I’ve learned and
                observed through this practice so far.
              </p>

              <h2 id="be-aware">Be aware.</h2>
              <p>
                Before I started this practice, meditation to me was a foreign
                idea, something I thought only monks did, or certainly wasn’t
                for a “regular” person like myself. I also thought meditation
                was extremely difficult to do, and even if I could convince
                myself to try to do it, I figured it would require considerable
                practice to really get started. I’ll show you right now why all
                of these preconceptions were wrong.
              </p>
              <h3>Breathe</h3>
              <p>
                No seriously, breathe right now. As you breathe in,
                <em>feel it</em> in your chest as your lungs fill with air.
                Focus on that feeling, letting everything else fade into the
                background. <em>Don’t judge</em> that feeling, just be aware of
                it. Now breathe out, continuing to hold onto that feeling.
                Breathe again, continuing to hold that focus. If your mind
                wanders, acknowledge the passing thought, and bring your focus
                back to the breath. Rinse &amp; repeat.
              </p>
              <p>Congrats, you just <em>~meditated~</em></p>
              <p>
                Everything else you may hear about meditation these days:
                meditation pillows, meditation apps, mantras &amp; sound bites,
                are only there to try to help you create an environment that is
                conducive to being able to sustain that focused awareness. At
                the end of the day, no matter what you do to create that mental
                space for yourself, don’t lose track of the real purpose of
                meditation: to simply be aware.
              </p>
              <p>Which leads into the next thing I’ve learned…</p>
              <p></p>
              <h2 id="be-awake">Be awake.</h2>
              <p>
                Through the 4 months of logging my daily meditation experiences,
                one of the trends I noticed more than anything else was that the
                easiest way to make meditation more difficult and less effective
                for myself was to try to do it when I’m sleepy. This isn’t to
                say it’s impossible, but it certainly makes it more challenging,
                like trying to go to the gym in a state of physical exhaustion.
              </p>
              <p>
                I typically do anywhere from 10–30 minutes of meditation per day
                (you can do as little or as much as you like), but even that
                small amount of time can seem like an eternity to your mind when
                you’re tired.&nbsp;
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the most effective ways that I’ve found to combat the
                possibility of falling asleep and to increase my awareness is to
                meditate right in the morning, after a shower &amp; a cup of
                joe. At that point, you should be awake enough that you aren’t
                going to fall back asleep but it’s still early enough in the day
                that you can approach that time with a fresh, clean slate of
                curiosity.
              </p>
              <p>Which leads me into my third observation…</p>
              <p></p>
              <h2 id="be-curious">Be curious.</h2>
              <p>
                Don’t take meditation too seriously. Meditation is just about
                being aware of what’s going on around you, so have fun with it
                and be curious about what you’ll find. Try not to think of
                meditation as something that is separate from your everyday
                life. Recognize that when you’re meditating, you’re living as
                fully as ever.
              </p>
              <p>
                When thoughts inevitably pop up during your meditation practice,
                be curious about what they are, observe them and acknowledge
                them, but then let them go.
              </p>
              <p>All in all, be sure to have fun, and…</p>
              <p></p>
              <h2 id="be-deliberate">Be deliberate.</h2>
              <p>
                If you’re going to meditate (as you should), don’t half-ass it.
                Be deliberate in what you want to achieve. Try your best in your
                meditation to bring your full energy and focus into that
                awareness, but recognize when your mind fails on that promise
                and find the capacity to admit it, forgive yourself, and try
                again.
              </p>
              <p>
                The best things in life are usually those worth working for.
                Meditation is something you need to practice, but its rewards
                are worth the effort. By being deliberate, you can be sure that
                you are focusing your energy in the most effective way.
              </p>
              <div style="text-align: center">• • •</div>
              <p><span></span></p>
              <p>
                I hope these few reflections help provide you with a bit of
                insight into what meditation is, and how you can get the most
                out of your practice. As you may note, the above musings could
                be applied to not only meditation but also to life in general.
                This shouldn’t really come as too big of a surprise given how
                meditation is simply living with more intentional awareness.
              </p>
              <p>
                So go out there, and enjoy each breath. Happy meditating, happy
                living&nbsp;:)

            Exactly one year ago, I joined Google DevRel with the hope of
            helping improve developer’s lives, making them more productive and
            successful while building on Google’s developer platform. With an
            amazing team supporting me, I was able to deliver on that dream for
            products such as Android TV and Nest, and ultimately this success
            was shown through the delivery of a talk this year at Google I/O.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today I’m excited to announce I’m starting my next adventure, this
            time outside of Google — but still within Alphabet — to help improve
            the lives of all those affected by disease. Today, I’m joining
            Verily to help develop tools and technologies that can detect
            diseases earlier, understand them better, and intervene more
            precisely.
          </p>
          <p id="p2">
            Thank you to everyone who has supported me in this decision. Working
            with such an incredible team within Google DevRel this past year has
            made this switch difficult to come to terms with, but I’m excited to
            start this new chapter of my life, with the ultimate dream of
            discovering the truth behind nature and disease.
